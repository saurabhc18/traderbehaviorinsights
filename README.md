# Trader Behavior Insights

Methodology
1. Data Preparation

Converted timestamps to daily dates.

Merged trader activity with same-day sentiment.

Checked for missing values and duplicates.

Created core metrics:
a.Daily PnL per trader
b.Win rate
c.Average position size
d.Trade frequency
e.Long/short ratio

3. Analysis

Compared Fear vs Greed regimes across:

Profitability (PnL, win rate, loss severity)

Trader behavior (position size, activity, directional bias)

Trader segments:
a.Frequent vs infrequent traders
b.Consistent vs inconsistent winners
c.High vs low position size traders

5. Insigths

Trader profitability and win rate differ between Fear and Greed regimes.

Average position size and trading activity increase during Fear periods, suggesting traders take larger and more frequent risks when sentiment is not optimistic.

Consistent traders perform close to high-activity or large-size traders, highlighting the importance of discipline.

4.Strategy Recommendations

Risk Reduction in Fear:
Reduce position size and avoid over-trading during Fear periods to limit drawdowns.

Selective Aggression in Greed:
Only traders with strong historical win rates should moderately increase exposure during Greed regimes.
